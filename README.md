# CV_AircraftDetection
Deeplearning project: Military Aircraft Detection ( Image and Video) Yolov8 
#### Transfer learning and Computer Vision Model Training

- This example provides a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) demonstrating how to train a YOLO model for military aircraft detection and model evaluation.

- Then integrated the trained model into a Streamlit project. 

- The included Streamlit demo makes it effortless to run the app—simply use the built-in file uploader to submit the sample image and video files stored in the GitHub repository
